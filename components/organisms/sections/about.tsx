        I was born in <strong>Figueira da Foz</strong>, a seaside city in
        Portugal's <strong>Coimbra</strong> district, but grew up a bit further
        south in <strong>Ilha</strong>, a village in the <strong>Leiria</strong>{' '}
        district. I spent most of my childhood in a small, quiet village full of
        pine trees. My parents' house was surrounded by these trees, and it was
        quite common to see rabbits and squirrels running around.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Ilha</strong> translates to <em>“island”</em> in Portuguese,
        which often makes people think I'm from <strong>Madeira</strong> or the{' '}
        <strong>Azores</strong>, a misunderstanding that has led to a few funny
        moments. Although <strong>Leiria</strong> is in central Portugal, our
        accent sometimes makes people think I'm from the north.

        Music was always playing at home. My dad learned to play guitar at a
        young age and turned that passion into a career. He has been teaching
        music for over 35 years and filled our house with classics from{' '}
        <em>Pink Floyd</em>, <em>The Rolling Stones</em>, and{' '}
        <em>Dire Straits</em>. My brother and I took it a step further and
        became regular fans of all sorts of <em>metal</em> subgenres. I still
        listen to it regularly, though I've grown to appreciate{' '}
        <em>bossa nova</em>, <em>jazz blues</em>, and <em>lo-fi</em> when I want
        something calmer.

        During my teenage years, I attended the same school where my dad was
        teaching music. I've always considered myself a good student. Whenever I
        had homework, I would do it right away so I could have the rest of the
        day to do whatever I wanted. My parents realized that, so they would let
        me have that freedom. And, of course, having my dad in the same school
        always helped me stay out of trouble.
      </p>

      <p>
        That school, however, was quite far from home. This meant the time I
        spent at school was also the only time I had to be with my friends, so
        weekends back home were usually quiet. Of course, I still had neighbors
        around my age, but I naturally found my own ways to escape boredom and
        stay entertained.

      <p>
        Having a computer at home helped a lot. <br />
        <strong>I spent countless hours exploring the digital world</strong>,
        playing online video games with strangers and chatting with them. It was
        my main source of English content and where I learned most of what I
        know today.

        In my early teens, my curiosity eventually led me to the{' '}
        <strong>Rubik's Cube</strong>. What started as a random challenge turned
        into a full-on obsession. Solving it over and over again became a
        routine. At some point, I was teaching others at school how to solve it,
        and eventually I participated in a competition in <strong>Porto</strong>
        . There, I met fellow <em>speedcubers</em> like myself and somehow even
        ended up in the national top rankings.

        I'm also a fan of <strong>jigsaw puzzles</strong> and usually have one
        ongoing somewhere at home. There's something relaxing about slowly
        fitting the pieces together, seeing parts of the image appear, and
        watching everything come together. When the last piece is in place, I
        let it sit for a day or so, then pack it all up and start a new one
        right away.

        <em>One of the first games I ever played was Minecraft</em>. The ability
        to explore, gather resources, and build anything I could imagine
        absolutely amazed me. The game had hundreds of different items, which
        also <strong>greatly helped me expand my English vocabulary</strong>.
        It's still one of my favorite games, and I play it from time to time
        whenever I have a bit of free time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Somewhere along the way, all those interests — logic, puzzles, and
        building things — made me realize that <strong>engineering</strong> was
        the path I wanted to follow. So that's what I did, and it turned out to
        be a great fit.
