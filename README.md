# Have You Met Xavier

This is my personal portfolio website, built to introduce myself and share a bit of my journey as a software developer. It includes an About page, my projects, professional experiences, and even some personal touches about what I enjoy outside of coding.

The goal of this site is to be clean, responsive, and fun to explore. It’s not just a resume, but more like a story you can scroll through, with a few interactive elements along the way.

The project is deployed with Vercel and built with modern web technologies. It’s designed to work across devices, from desktop to mobile, without losing readability or personality.
